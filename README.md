# AppliedQuantumChemistry-Poitiers

This repository basically gathers links to various programs developed by the Applied Quantum Chemistry group, Institute of Chemistry of Materials and Media of Poitiers. 

[FASTCAR](https://github.com/FGueganUP/2FAST2CAR/tree/main): a Python-based program for the exploration of conformational degrees of freedom along reaction paths, using CREST augmented with RMSD-, reaction coordinate-tailored structure pruning, and DFT calculations.
